Generating Brain Tumor MRI images for Data Augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks

About Brain Tumor:

A brain tumor is a collection, or mass, of abnormal cells in your brain. Your skull, which encloses your brain, is very rigid. Any growth inside such a restricted space can cause problems. Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). When benign or malignant tumors grow, they can cause the pressure inside your skull to increase. This can cause brain damage, and it can be life-threatening. Brain tumors are categorized as primary or secondary:

A primary brain tumor originates in your brain. Many primary brain tumors are benign.
A secondary brain tumor, also known as a metastatic brain tumor, occurs when cancer cells spread to your brain from another organ, such as lung or breast.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):

An MRI uses magnetic fields to produce detailed images of the body.
MRI can be used to measure the tumor’s size. A special dye called a contrast medium is given before the scan to create a clearer picture.
This dye can be injected into a patient’s vein or given as a pill or liquid to swallow.
MRIs create more detailed pictures than CT scans and are the preferred way to diagnose a brain tumor.
The MRI may be of the brain, spinal cord, or both, depending on the type of tumor suspected and the likelihood that it will spread in the CNS.
There are different types of MRI. The results of a neuro-examination, done by the internist or neurologist, helps determine which type of MRI to use.

What do the Numbers Say?

In India, every year, 40,000 - 50,000 patients are diagnosed with a brain tumor. 20 percent of them are children
At the current population level of the country (1.417 billion), this means only 0.0035 percent are diagnosed with Brain Tumor!
Let's assume that all MRI scans produce 100% accurate results. This would mean that for every 10,000 MRI scans, we only get 35 samples showing Brain Tumor versus many more that don't
This, combined with other problems in accessing Medical data, would lead to Machine Learning problems such as Class Imbalance and Bias
